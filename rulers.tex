%%%% This file is meant to be printed three times, so as to have three sets of
%%%% 14-m rulers and 9 small 30-cm rulers. The rulers will be used on top and on
%%%% one side of a flume at the University of South Carolina, and on a bunch of
%%%% mounts placed atop the flume. It will be printed in low tack Photo Tex
%%%% paper.
